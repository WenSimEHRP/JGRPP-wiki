## Order window features

### Through load

This feature allows freight trains longer than the station platform to load/unload in stages, moving through the platform, instead of all at once.

To enabled this feature in the order window, enable the "Show advanced loading mode features" setting.

The \[near end\]/\[middle\]/\[far end\] position selector can also be changed to \[through load\].

### Reverse order lists

To reverse a vehicle's order list, or append or reversed copy of the order list, click the **End of Orders** marker.

Then select the "Reverse order list" or "Append reversed order list" options in the "Manage List" drop-down box.  
(If the order management button toggle hasn't been enabled, the "Manage List" drop-down box can be temporarily shown by holding the **CTRL** key.)
