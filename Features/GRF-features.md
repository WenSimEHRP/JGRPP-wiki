## GRF features

### Extra station names

Version 0.42.3 adds a feature where NewGRFs may supply extra station name strings.

These extra station name strings are used when all the default names have been used up, instead of "Town Station #NNN".

A sample GRF can be found here: [extra station names sample GRF](https://github.com/JGRennison/extra-station-names-sample-grf).
