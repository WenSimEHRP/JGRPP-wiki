## GRF features

### Extra station names

Version 0.42.3 adds a feature where NewGRFs may supply extra station name strings.

These extra station name strings are used when all the default names have been used up, instead of "Town Station #NNN".

A sample GRF can be found here: [extra station name strings GRF](Features/extra-station-names/extra_station_names_sample.grf), [NFO source](Features/extra-station-names/extra_station_names_sample.nfo).

For GRF author documentation, [see here](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/JGRennison/OpenTTD-patches/blob/jgrpp/docs/newgrf-additions.html#a0globalsettings).
